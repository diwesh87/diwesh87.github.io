<Callout intent="success">Outcome: **50% ↓ time-to-hire** with an AI-augmented ATS.</Callout>

## Context
Noble House needed hiring to move at the speed of business. Legacy tools created latency and blind spots across sourcing, screening, and scheduling. We set a singular KPI: **cut time-to-hire by half** while increasing candidate satisfaction. *(Metric sourced from my resume.)*

## Problem
- Recruiters were juggling multiple systems; data-entry and follow-ups slowed offers.
- Screening lacked consistent, fair scoring; interviews clashed; funnel drop-off was invisible.

## Constraints
- Integrate with existing job boards/HRIS.
- Preserve auditability and reduce bias; support remote-first teams.

## My role & team
I served as **CTO and architect**, leading cross-functional squads (product, data, platform, QA). I defined the KPI model, architecture, and an evaluation harness for ranking quality.

## Approach
1. **Discovery & KPI model** — mapped current funnel and baseline SLAs.  
2. **Data pipeline** — resume ingestion and canonical candidate profile.  
3. **Ranking & rules** — skill signals, recency, constraints; human-oversight loops.  
4. **Scheduling & comms** — automated calendars, SMS/email nudges.  
5. **Funnel analytics** — time-in-stage, drop-off, and alerting.  
6. **Evals & guardrails** — weekly tests for precision/cost/latency; bias checks.

## Architecture (at a glance)
Ingestion (parsers/webhooks) → Profile Store (PostgreSQL) → Ranker API (Python) → Orchestrator (.NET) → UI (React) → BI (funnel dashboards) → Notification service (email/SMS).

## What we built
- **Resume parsing + profile unification** with manual overrides.  
- **Ranking service** combining rules + learned signals; **HITL** review queues.  
- **One-click scheduling** with calendar sync and candidate preferences.  
- **Funnel dashboards** with SLA alerts; **offer workflow** with approvals.

## Results
- **50% ↓ time-to-hire** and faster recruiter response times.  
- Higher candidate satisfaction; fewer drop-offs at screening/interview.  
- Reliable reporting for leadership and clients.

## Lessons
- Data hygiene beats model cleverness.  
- Guardrails + evaluation harness keep models honest as volume grows.

## Next
- Integrate structured interview rubrics; expand fairness audits; add sourcing marketplace.
