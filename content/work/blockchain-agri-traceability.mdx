## Context
Agriculture stakeholders needed a tamper-evident way to verify crop provenance and reduce fraud in the value chain.

## Problem
Paper trails were fragmented; bad actors could substitute lots without detection; audits were costly and slow.

## My role & team
As **CTO**, I led architecture, chain selection, and rollout across pilots. I coordinated with regulators and supply partners.

## Approach
- **Process mapping → on-chain events** (harvest, transport, storage, sale).  
- **Identity & permissions** for each actor; off-chain docs anchored on-chain.  
- **Lot tokenization** for handoffs; QR-based scans updating state transitions.  
- **Analytics** overlay for anomaly detection and audit trails.

## Architecture
Mobile scanning → API gateway → Chain (Hyperledger/Ethereum) + IPFS docs → Analytics warehouse.

## Results
- **30% ↓ fraud**; faster dispute resolution; better retailer confidence.  
- Auditable trail ready for spot checks and compliance.

## Lessons
- UX of scanning and offline modes determines adoption, not chain choice.  
- Start with a **narrow lot type**; expand once incentives align.
