## Context
A set of business-critical systems needed capacity headroom, reliability, and cost control—without an outage window.

## Approach
- **Blueprint & risk log** (dependencies, data gravity, RTO/RPO).  
- **IaC** with Terraform; **progressive cutover** via blue-green + DNS.  
- **Observability** first: SLIs/SLOs, golden signals, error budgets.  
- **Perf & cost**: autoscaling, right-sizing, storage tiers.

## Results
- **60% ↑ scalability**; **zero downtime** migration; lower monthly spend.  
- Faster incident resolution with dashboards and alerts.

## Lessons
- "Measure before move": bake in observability **before** flipping traffic.  
- Progressive cutover beats big-bang.

## CTA
