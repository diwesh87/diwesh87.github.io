## Context
Fragmented tools slowed triage and follow-ups. The goal: a cohesive, secure digital front door for care.

## Approach
- **Patient app**: symptoms, appointments, reports vault.  
- **Doctor portal**: queue, telehealth, e-prescriptions.  
- **Technician app**: tasking, route-planning, vitals capture.  
- **EHR gateway** with audit trails; consent flows; HIPAA-style controls.

## Results
- Faster triage; reduced missed appointments; better continuity across roles.  
- Higher patient satisfaction with transparent updates.

## Lessons
- Small, reliable flows (booking → consult → follow-up) beat mega suites.  
- Privacy and consent UX is a product feature, not a checkbox.
