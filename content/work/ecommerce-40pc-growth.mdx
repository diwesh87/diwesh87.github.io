## Context
The store plateaued; speed and funnel friction hurt conversions.

## Approach
- **Perf**: critical CSS, image strategy, edge caching.  
- **CRO**: hypothesis backlog, A/B tests on PDP, cart, checkout.  
- **Trust**: reviews, guarantees, and clear delivery/returns.

## Results
- **+40%** sales; lower bounce; higher checkout completion.
